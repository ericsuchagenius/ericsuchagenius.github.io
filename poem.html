		In brief, the removals are about much more than simply eliminating Indigenous Peoples, although it does involve this. A race is made a part of targeting.3 Blacks are racialized as slaves; slavery is what makes them black. For example, Indians and Blacks in America were racialized oppositely, reflecting their opposite roles in shaping American society.    Show Source Texts
One in seven inmates is serving life, and almost half of this group is Black. As of 2020, the U.S. had approximately 580,000 people without housing, of which 39% were Black, though they make up just 12% of the overall U.S. population. Police have also continued to kill Native Americans, Latinos, and Black people at substantially higher rates - up to 350 percent more often than whites.    Show Source Texts
The genocide of Indians in America, or Indigenous Australians, has been unaffected by electoral results. Yet since 1867, when Congress ordered Southern states to remove race discrimination from the ballot, African-Americans began winning elections throughout the South. Southern Blacks won elections to Southern state governments, and even the United States Congress, during Reconstruction (1865-1877).    Show Source Texts
During Radical Reconstruction, beginning with the passage of the Reconstruction Acts in 1867, newly freed Black men gained a voice in government for the first time in American history, winning elections to Southern state legislatures and even to the U.S. Congress. Under President Andrew Johnsons administration, new Southern state legislatures passed restrictive Black codes to monitor the work and conduct of formerly enslaved and other African-Americans during 1865 and 1866.

The Civil War and its aftermath permanently ended legal slavery in the country, but African Americans were still second-class citizens, and women were still fighting to participate fully in U.S. social life. Unfortunately, many of those freedoms would be short-lived, as the U.S. withdrew from Reconstruction. These tactics were hard, but many were achieved in countries that were much more violent and politically unstable than American democracies are today.    Show Source Texts

It is no wonder, then, that many within the establishment--particularly the ones who had prospered under existing rules--resisted.    Show Source Texts
Some will readily adjust to new rules -- a handful might even catch you off guard -- but others will not prosper. Keeping around people who are being made obsolete might be compassionate, but it is dangerous to an organization.

		The digital revolution has already changed how people live, work, and communicate. And it’s only just getting started. But the same technologies that have the potential to help billions of people live happier, healthier, and more productive lives are also creating new challenges for citizens and governments around the world. From election meddling to data breaches and cyberattacks, recent events have shown that technology is changing how we think about privacy, national security, and maybe even democracy itself. In this project, we examine challenges in five key areas that will shape the future of the digital age: justice system, impact on democracy, global security and international conflict, the impact of automations and AI on the jobs marketplace, identity, and privacy. Explore provocative and through-provoking topics on how technology impacts our lives

feelings we experience every day, it affect us silently, how can we cope with them?


	What are sadness, anger and pain?
Sadness is a feeling of distress and despondency, often related to some form of loss (a death, an ending of a relationship or a job, a change of a circumstance etc.). You may feel drained, lethargic, or just “unmotivated”. Physically, you may experience a constriction in your throat, tightness in your chest, a lump in your throat, or tearfulness. You may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, or you may eat more or less than usual. Anger is a feeling of resentment, exasperation, impatience, or outrage. It is commonly associated with a “fight or flight” response, which means that you may have certain physical sensations, such as increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, muscle tensing, a flushed face, or a need to break something. Pain is an unpleasant feeling that can range from mild and fleeting to severe enough to impede daily activities and even impact one’s ability to work or care for one’s self. This experience can vary widely, and can be the result of an injury, illness, or disease. It may also occur as a side effect of treatment for a health condition.

	The importance of recognizing these feelings
Our thoughts and emotions carry a great deal of power. When we are able to recognize them and understand what they are telling us, they can become our most valuable resource. They are there to guide us through life and to help us achieve our goals and dreams. However, they can also be our worst enemy when we don’t understand their language. Recognizing the feelings, especially the negative ones, can help you to decipher what they are trying to tell you. When you are able to recognize the feelings, you can also evaluate where they are coming from. This can be helpful for reducing the intensity of the emotions, as well as for finding ways to cope with them and getting them under control.

	Tips for dealing with sadness, anger and pain
- Developing self-awareness This is the first and most important step towards managing your emotions. Self-awareness is closely linked to mindfulness, which is the practice of being present in the moment. It involves observing your thoughts and feelings without judgement, while also paying attention to your physical sensations. When you are able to step back and observe your thoughts and feelings, you gain the power to choose how you want to respond to them. - Practicing self-care Taking care of yourself is crucial when you are experiencing negative emotions. This doesn’t mean that you should “push through” the emotions or ignore them. In fact, trying to “ignore” your emotions is likely to make them last longer, while taking care of yourself helps you to let go of them much more quickly. Taking care of yourself may mean having more rest, eating healthier, exercising, connecting with friends, writing in a journal, etc. There are many ways to take care of yourself, so you have to choose the ones that fit your lifestyle and personality. - Seeking support In many cases, negative emotions are completely normal. They often come from facing a significant life change or significant loss, or from a medical condition. In these cases, the emotions are temporary and are likely to pass. However, in some cases, negative emotions may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as depression or anxiety. In this case, they won’t go away on their own, and you will need to seek professional help. If you are experiencing intense emotions that are affecting your daily activities and relationships, you should seek support. Talking to a professional can help you to understand your emotions and find ways to cope with them. - Expressing emotions in healthy ways This is closely linked to the previous point. However, it is important to understand that there are two basic emotions – love and fear. The other emotions are variations of these two, or combinations of them. Anger, for example, is a combination of fear and love. Sadness is a combination of fear and love. When you are feeling angry, don’t try to “calm down”. Instead, express your “fear”. Find out what you are afraid of, and do the opposite. Confronting the situation that you are afraid of is the best way to overcome it.

	When to seek professional help
If you are experiencing negative emotions that don’t seem to go away after a few days, or if you find that they are negatively impacting your daily activities and relationships, it is important to seek professional help. Certain types of negative emotions, such as grief and sadness, are normal. However, if you find that they are lasting for more than a couple of weeks, it is important to get help. Now you know what sadness, anger and pain are, as well as ways to cope with them. These feelings are normal, but they can become problematic if left unchecked. By following the tips that we have provided for you, you can effectively manage these emotions and lead a happier, healthier life.</p>
